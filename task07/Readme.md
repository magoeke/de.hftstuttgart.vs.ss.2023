# Getting Started

We're going to build a small application which displays continents and countries of the world.
The frontend is already there, you need to integrate a GraphQL API to fetch the data from.
You can access GraphiQL of this API with the url [https://countries.trevorblades.com/](https://countries.trevorblades.com/).

Play around with the API and get familiar with available queries and the fields of the returned objects as well as the relations.

# Task 07

Let's develop a web app which displays continent and country information.
You need to provide the needed GraphQL queries and configure the GraphQL Client to use the correct documents.

1. Generate all necessary files (`maven compile`)
2. Add the necessary GraphQL queries in the folder `graphql-documents`
3. Configure the `CountryClient` by filling in the variables and documents
4. Test the frontend if all information is displayed correctly
