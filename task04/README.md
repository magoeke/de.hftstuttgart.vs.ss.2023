# Getting started

This task is about Spring HATEOAS and Spring REST Docs.

TODO 01 - 03 deal with Spring HATEOAS. Add the missing links. The TODO comments explain which links you should add.

For the second part of this task edit the `InvoiceAPITest` file. Additional to that have a look at the file `all_invoices.doc`. 
Execute `maven install` and look at the file in `target/generated-docs/index.html` to see the result. (TODO 04 - 07)
